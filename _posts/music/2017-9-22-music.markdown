# Recent Listening Experiences

I try to constantly search for music that is new to my ears no matter how new it is to the world. I want to always continue to widen the genres of music that I am exposed to. Here are some of the songs that I have listened to recently (in no particular order):

|   Artist                  |   Song            |
|---------------            |---------------    |
| Roosevelt                 | Night Moves       |
| Roosevelt                 | Hold On           |
| Roosevelt                 | Heart             |
| The Weeknd ft. Daft Punk  | I Feel It Coming  |
| Beck                      | Dreams            |

Sometimes it is a blessing to find the time to listen to full albums in an uninterrupted experience. Here are some albums that I have recently enjoyed beginning to end:
