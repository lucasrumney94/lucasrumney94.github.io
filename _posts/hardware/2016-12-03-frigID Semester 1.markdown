I recently participated in North Carolina State University's [ECE Senior Design Day][dday]. Students are given the choice of working on around 30 different projects that are sponsored by either companies or professors.

My team's project was frigID. Our project will let a shopper know what is in their fridge while they are out shopping. 


By this Design Day we were tasked with completing a basic prototype. The prototype takes pictures of the interior of a user's fridge, allowing the user to view those pictures on any web-enabled device. 

Imagine being at the store, wondering whether or not you need milk. With frigID, you can check on the fly.  


This is our poster from design day.
