**Notifications**

When (and how) should you notify a user?

"Alexa, set an alarm for 7:30AM"

*"alarm set for 7:30AM tomorrow"*

I was to wake at a normal time, for normal people. Naturally, I chose over the past 2 weeks of break to upset my sleep schedule as much as possible, leaving me with only a hint of a hope of waking up a that time. Morning came, and I, having heard Alexa chirp at me right on time, told Alexa to shutup. I rolled back over, but due to my astoundingly firm sense of duty (regardless of how early it is), I told her to set an alarm for 8:00AM.

*"alarm set for 8:00AM"*

At 7:59AM, nothing happened. I was completely unaware of the world, asleep, and probably flying a Zepplin through space.

At 8:00AM, two events ocurred. Alexa dinged and welcomed me into the world and the fire alarm for my building went off.

Startled, I quickly get dressed, grabbed my wallet and keys, and headed out the door. It was cold. I went out the the nearest clearing, saw some people walking away from the building, and waited for the alarm to stop. After about 8 minutes, it stopped.

I made my way slowly back to my apartment, ears still ringing from the alarms. I continued my day: I went to work, I worked, I came home, I worked, I ate dinner, I relaxed, I slept.

The next morning, I was awaken again by the fire alarm. At this point in time, I had a choice. This fire alarm happened at exactly the same time, the very next day. There was an extremely high probability that it was another failure (or test I was not informed of). I could stay inside, cover my ears, and attempt to get ready for work. On the other hand, covering my ears and getting properly ready for work seemed ridiculous, so I just threw on some clothes and walked outside. No one was walking out of the building. The only passing soul, a security guard admitted he had no idea why it was going off.

A Fire Alarm is a dangerous thing if it doesn't work.
I would say that a fire alarm's purpose is to inform people of a fire on the premesis. Residents, having experienced the first alarm, ignored the second. Therefore, a fire alarm that goes off all the time doesn't work.

Another, more common example of this is the widespread usage of the "CAUTION: WET FLOOR" sign, which coincidentally is the only reason I know the Spanish word for caution. It's a sign used at so many businesses to try to avoid injury liability, yet I've seen them left in place for weeks. In that case, a warning becomes ignorable decor.

**Internet of Notifications**

An internet of notifications is not a far cry from my fire alarm situation. My internet life is my apartment. While terms and conditions are the wallpaper... "We use cookies on this site to help you" is the baseboard, and "Subscribe to our newsletter!" is a TV that starts screaming advertisements at you just as you are about to leave. Lastly, Alexa is my fire alarm: Always listening for one thing and *always* going off.

How many notifications does it take for a notification to be meaningless?

Think about how we use email today in our personal lives. Does it have as much value as it did ten years ago? Or have we given in to the tide of subscriptions and email notifications washing away our willingness to use email?
I would say that many people still heavily utilize email, at work. At least for me personally, outside of work, email has ceased it's useful life. Now, notifications rule the landscape.

With notifications, especially on mobile devices, there is not a second in a day that you don't have a wingding sitting in your push notifications from somewhere about something. Once we move from email-space to notification-space, its really easy to think of these notifications as units of time.  

To be frank, most notifications are not important, yet product designers never think that about their own product. In almost the same way, Professors do not consider how much homework you have from other courses when assigning time consuming work. While a fire alarm should wake me up, Candy Crush push notifications are in no way comparable.

My phone puts applications to sleep, gets a low battery, cleans my temp data, and charges. With each of these comes a notification, all with a user response required.

pic related.

Hey! I just put 3 applications to sleep.

Hey! My battery is less than 15%.

Hey! Press here to clean up 20MB of data.

Hey! I'm charging!

Hey! I'm 100% charged!

and finally (and seemingly out of spite),

HEY! YOU HAVE NEW EMAIL!

My phone has an indicator LED, the screen entirely lights up, the phone vibrates, the phone chirps, and the edges of the screen even light up separately in case you flip your phone screen-down on your desk!

I know that I can effectively turn off 90% of this, block emails, and disable certain features on my phone if I wanted to root it... But should I have to? Is this the default-is-on notification setting world we want our children to inherit?

Another Notification that occurs every time I turn off my cell data.

**Gamification**

*The ads will be the content.
The content will be the ads.*

Until we have real AI butlers to sort our lives out for us, it will be our fate as consumers to have our patience stretched thin and our brains scattered by micro-interruptions purporting to be agents of multitasking zen.

Slowly, content will contain more advertisement, monetization, and predatory design until it becomes the standard. Television, Computers, Websites, Mobile Games (pick your generation) are the quintessential example of this trend.

What is the next frontier?
