Here are some older game projects I had the pleasure of working on:

Sixteen is intended for online and mobile release. It is the result of a weekend-long game jam.

Inter-gel-actic was also the result of a game jam. This project had no dedicated artist and its focus was on playing with movement mechanics and AI.

IMFB is a game inspired by a game called Super Monkey Ball, which I really enjoyed as a kid. This is one of my first functionally complete Unity game projects.
