I have been exploring glitch art. 


![Photo]({{site.url}}/assets/img/11-6-2016/DSC00094.jpg)



I recently entered North Carolina State University's [CODE+ART][codeartinfo] competition and won 3rd place with my piece ["Spiral's Edge"][myentry]. Be patient, as it may take a while to load and run at a low framerate. It was built for a [high power computer running a uncommon resolution array of screens.][artwall]

Library Article Excerpt:

"    Rumney’s “Spiral’s Edge” animates different 3D models and structures based on composite sine waves -- a simple pattern that appears in almost every discipline within mathematics or engineering. Visually beautiful, complex images emerge when constructive and destructive interference is introduced     "
