### Hello, My name is Lucas Rumney.
I am currently a Test Development Engineer for an up-and-coming network startup called Cisco. In my free time I love to develop games, make music, and even play around with photography, art, and small hardware projects. I am very passionate about Virtual Reality. I want to continue to make games and slowly progress to application development using Unity3D and the HTC Vive. You might see me driving around the South Bay area in my 1987 Nissan 300ZX or hopping on Caltrain to spend a music-filled weekend in SF.
